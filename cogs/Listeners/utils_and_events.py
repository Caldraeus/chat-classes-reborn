üëã Hello! Thanks for adding me to your server!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
1. One of the classes in the bot (`Archmage`) has AI integration. It reads 50 messages from a user when activated. If there‚Äôs a channel with information you don‚Äôt want shared with OpenAI, please use `/channel disable`. (*Note that these messages read by the bot are [never saved](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).*)
2. I also do a lot of fun and silly things with chat and people's messages. If this isn‚Äôt okay, you should run the same `/channel disable` command.
3. Please ensure that you have obtained consent from your users before enabling features that affect their messages. Make sure to inform your users about these functionalities or disable the bot in channels that might be heavily affected by the silliness!
